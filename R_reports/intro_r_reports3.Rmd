# Report on Life Expectancy over Time

Data was analyzed from the Gapminder data.


## Life Expectancy over time

I analyzed the gapminder data representing the life expectancy from 142 countries from 1952 to 1997.

```{r load_pkgs, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r load_data, echo=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.table("../Data/Data/gapminder.txt", header=TRUE)
```

```{r plot_data, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
    geom_point() +
  labs(
        x = "Year",
        y = "Life Expectancy",
        title = "Life Expectancy over time"
    ) 
```

The data is color coded by continent.

Thank you!
